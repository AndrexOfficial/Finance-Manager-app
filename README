Finance Manager iPhone App
--------------------------

Description: 
This is an expenses tracking app. The user can set monthly budgets and add daily expenses. The expenses and budgets can be visualized using pie charts.

Some of the implemented iOS SDK elements: 
* UITabBarControlelr
* UINavigationController
* UIActionSheet
* UIPickerview
* SQLite Database Library

This would be a good code sample for people looking at implementing an UIPicker inside an ActionSheet, Splash Screen with transition effects, view switching between multiple views and DB operations

Known Issues:
In the Expense Summary tab, the month & year are hard coded. So it'd work only if you are trying this app before 31st Dec 2011.
